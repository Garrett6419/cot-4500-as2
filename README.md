# cot-4500-as2
Programming Assignment 2 for COT 4500, Numerical Calculus

- Neville's Method for Polynomial Interpolation
- Newton's Forward Method for Polynomial Approximation
- Divided Differences Method for Hermite Polynomial Approximation
- Cubic Spline Interpolation

- Before testing anything, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can find these libraries in requirements.txt.

- To use the assignment_2.py, navigate to the src file and run: 

    python main/assignment_2.py

- This will output the results of the following methods:

- Result of the Neville's method for polynomial interpolation.
- Table generated by the Newton's forward method for polynomial approximation.
- Approximation of a function value using the results from the Newton's forward method.
- Hermite polynomial approximation matrix using the divided differences method.
- Coefficients for cubic spline interpolation.
- To use the test_assignment_2.py, navigate to the test file and run:

    python -m unittest test_assignment_2

- This will run all the test cases in test_assignment_2.py to test the functions in assignment_2.py.
